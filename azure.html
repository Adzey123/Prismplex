<h1> Azure Smp</h1>
<p>Our current server for players, the Azure SMP is online with updates from the staff team regularly from updating admin shops to large economy resets and/or changes. The server is peacefull making use of a land claim plugin but griefing and stealing is still not allowed. 

  The economy has commands including 
  
  /pay and /bal 
  
  There are a lot of land claim commands but the basics are 
  
  /lands create, /lands claim, /lands trust, /lands delete, /lands unclaim more details can be found at LINKLINK.LINK.LK, on the sign behind spawn or in the command overview document linked below 
  
  The server uses MCMMO for leveling up skills to add another goal to the game, the plugin doesnâ€™t intrude on gameplay that much as it just gives buffs to basic features such as a chance of double drops when resource gathering or stronger bows, these increase as you play and level up,its easy to learn. If you need contact @zeyzy or @lentex and we will help you disable the plugin on your end  if you find it intrusive on gameplay. 
  
  The server has a town at spawn that includes admin shops to get money and rentable plots to create your own player shop, guides for how to do this are in the command overview document or you can just ask another player. 
  
  When you spawn you can explore spawn and run from there or use the /wild command to get to a random location to start normal gameplay from. 
  
  We do have a reseting mine behind spawn for resource gathering but we encourage players to embrace survival Minecraft and go caving and start making an epic base. 
  
  If you have any questions just ask in #general, #azure or in game chat and another player will help you. </p>
