            <p>As a friendly community full of LGBTQIA+ and neurodivergent people, we have rules to keep the server
                friendly and a safe space for all.</p>

        <section id="basics" style="background-color: #fff; padding: 20px; margin: 10px;">
            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't advertise other servers or your own servers. Self-promotion is allowed (social media such as youtube as an example) but please use common
                    sense and don't spam or send it to unrelated channels.</li>
                <li>The staff team has the final say over this to keep the server clean.</li>
                <li>Please keep the contents of the server PG friendly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="ingame-rules" style="background-color: #fff; padding: 20px; margin: 10px;">
            <h3>In-Game Rules on Azure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Harassment, unprovoked PVP, griefing, stealing, client mods that give a large advantage (hacks) and anything else deemed unsuitable by the staff are not allowed on the server. Lightmatica, coordinate overlays and other non-unfair mods are okay. 
                    
                </li>
                <li>In game on azure please keep chat friendly, dont send stuff you wouldnt say to a 12 year old.</li>
                <li>If a player is breaking the rules or suspected of cheating, please DM a staff member (such as @zeyzy
                    or @lentex) or message in #general.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Please use spoiler tags to censor sensitive topics and provide content or trigger warnings when

                <li>Our real_talk channel is for serious conversations, so please be sensitive and respectful.</li>
